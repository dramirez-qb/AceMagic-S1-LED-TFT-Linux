# VentureM starts his work on this TFT
# Thats an excellent start point for me !! - My rant starts

So I have had this machine for about 6 mmonths, am one of the early adopters. However I was stuck with the same issue, the TFT can only be used in Windows and with the warnings I was  getting in Windows, I was not planning to keep running windows.
The original purpose of this machine was to work as a home server so that I could run m,y LLM experiments on this, while utilising cloud instances and other powerfull local machines for actual computing needs.
Once I installed Bodhilinux, I founf myself stuck with clock display and nothing else. Probing the USB devices led to below :

Now the challenge was to understand what was going on here - but due to work commitments I could not spend too much time on this.
As a result even today (31 March 2024), the TFT still shows time only :)

## And we have the next issue.
It seems that the default firmware is coded to show time, but the developer did not bother with intricacies like Daylight Time Savings - so today when UK rolls back time, the clock is one hour behind with no other option but to work on this issue.
Many thanks to the OP for starting this thread; and time and effort spent in capturing the data paclets.


## 07-04-2024 LED control is implemented !!! 

The LED control has been implemented in python using PySerial - did need a few reboots into Windoz to get the CRC right, but I belive it is now fixed and working as expected.
Please raise an issue if you find a bug, I'll endeavour to replicate and fix the issue.

## XX-04-2024 Next is to implement the TFT screen handler 

## XX-XX-2024 Create a FAST API to control this from endpoint

## XX-XX-2024 Later to dockerise the whole thing

# AceMagic-S1-LED-TFT-Linux
ACEMAGIC S1 Mini TFT/LCD Control for Linux

# First: My Rant

While this mini PC offers impressive features, the absence of information regarding the TFT front screen and LED strip is frustrating. Despite being advertised as 'with DIY LCD Display' on Amazon, the lack of Linux support is disappointing. My objective is to enable control of these devices in Linux, facilitating integration with projects like Batocera.linux. If you're interested in contributing to this effort, please reach out. work is much in progress.

## LED Strip

The LED strip from what I gather is controlled by the USB-SERIAL CH340.

![alt text](images/ch340.png?raw=true)

## TFT-LCD Display

The TFT-LCD display is controlled via the USB HID device. the control board has a Holtek HT32 chip on it. There is some firmware doing the drawing. 

![alt text](images/tft-lcd.png?raw=true)

    DeviceClass             : HIDCLASS
    DeviceID                : HID\VID_04D9&PID_FD01&MI_00\7&3A7B026B&0&0000
    DeviceName              : HID-compliant consumer control device
    HardWareID              : HID\VID_04D9&PID_FD01&REV_0110&MI_00

    DeviceClass             : HIDCLASS
    DeviceID                : HID\VID_04D9&PID_FD01&MI_01\7&16A3C4A9&0&0000
    DeviceName              : HID-compliant vendor-defined device
    HardWareID              : HID\VID_04D9&PID_FD01&REV_0110&MI_01

the HT32 control board:

as you can see in the photo below, the sample traffic sent to the device:

![alt text](images/capture1.png?raw=true)

## commands for TFT screen

all commands have an 8 byte header. total buffer sent is always 4104 bytes, that is 8 bytes for header, and 4096 for data. the header always starts with a signature byte (0x55), followed by command byte and a sub command byte. 

#### set_orientation (0xA1 0xF1)

```c++
struct set_orientation {
    uint8_t header;      // 0x55
    uint8_t command1;    // 0xA1
    uint8_t command2;    // 0xF1 = set orientation
    uint8_t orientation; // 0x01 = landscape, 0x02 = portrait
    uint8_t unused[4];
};
```

data look like this:
```
55 a1 f1 02 00 00 00
```

the "Disconnection, content information display will not be allowed!" will show correct orientation

#### set_time (0xA1 0xF2)

this is used to keep the internal clock updated and as a heartbeat..

```c++
struct set_time {
    uint8_t header;   // 0x55
    uint8_t command1; // 0xA1
    uint8_t command2; // 0xF2 (heartbeat) or 0xF3 (set time) 
    uint8_t hour;     // 0x0E = 14 hours (2pm)
    uint8_t minute;   // 0x1C = 28 minutes
    uint8_t second;   // 0x2D = 45 seconds
    uint8_t unused[2];
};
```

data looks like this:
```
55 a1 f2 0e 1c 2d 00 00    2:28:45
55 a1 f2 0e 1c 2e 00 00    2:28:46
```
 
#### redraw (0xA3)

bitblt the entire screen

```c++
struct lcd_redraw {
    uint8_t header;   // 0x55
    uint8_t command1; // 0xA3
    uint8_t command2; // 0xF0 = start, 0xF1 = continue, 0xF2 = end
    uint8_t sequence; // 0x01 - 0x1B
    uint16_t offset;  // 
    uint16_t length;  //
};
```

data looks like this (image data omited):

```
    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7    offset - length
   55 a3 f0 01 00 00 00 10         0 - 4096

```

> [!WARNING]
> The offset field is ignored since it wraps around back to 0 at sequence 0x11. I am assuming the firmware will use the sequence to figure out the offset. 

#### update (0xA2)

bitblt portion of the framebuffer at x,y coordinates. this will send small image data to update, this data can be anything. because the framebuffer is slow, this is used to update portions of the framebuffer quickly.

```c++
struct lcd_update {
    uint8_t header;   // 0x55
    uint8_t command;  // 0xA2
    uint16_t x;       // 0x0012 x=18
    uint16_t y;       // 0x0032 y=50
    uint8_t width;    // 0x18 w=24
    uint8_t height;   // 0x0C h=12
};
```

data looks like this (image data omited):

```
55 a2 12 00 32 00 18 0c 
55 a2 12 00 26 00 18 0c 
55 a2 12 00 18 00 18 0c 
55 a2 12 00 0a 00 18 0c
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can set any size update region (up to 254 width, and 170 height) as long as the pixel data does not exceed the total size of the 4096 buffer limit. for example, w=51, h=40 (51 x 40 x 2 = 4080 bytes) or w=102, h=20 (102 x 20 x 2 = 4080). there is a fine balance between how big each update region is vs how fast you need the area updated. The max update region size are 254 x 4 and 12 x 170.

## Image Data

the screen is a 320 x 170 x 2 (16-bit color) framebuffer. the 0,0 is upper right when in portrait orientation, or upper left when in landscape. the pixel format is RGB565. had to do an endian swap when setting the pixel.

```c++

#define RGB565(r, g, b) (((r & 0x1F) << 11) | ((g & 0x3F) << 5) | (b & 0x1F))
#define SWAPENDIAN(num) (num>>8) | (num<<8);

color = RGB565(red, green, blue);
*pixel = SWAPENDIAN(color);

```

here is an example cycle through red, green, blue, and a color gradient. sorry about the quality, it looks much better in person.

![alt text](images/framebuffer.gif?raw=true)
![alt text](images/colors_small.png?raw=true)

here is the code for the above:

```c++
const int width = 320;
const int height = 170;

unsigned char *framebuffer =  (unsigned char *)calloc(width * height, 2);

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    unsigned char* ptr = framebuffer;

    for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {

        for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {

            uint16_t* pixel = (uint16_t*)ptr;
            uint16_t color = 0;

            switch (i) {

                case 0:  // black, clear the screen
                    break;

                case 1:  // red
                    {
                        uint8_t intensity = (uint8_t)((y * 31) / (height - 1));
                        color = RGB565(intensity, 0, 0);
                    }
                    break;
                case 2: // green
                    {
                        uint8_t intensity = (uint8_t)((y * 63) / (height - 1));
                        color = RGB565(0, intensity, 0);
                    }
                    break;
                case 3: // blue
                    {
                        uint8_t intensity = (uint8_t)((y * 31) / (height - 1));
                        color = RGB565(0, 0, intensity);
                    }
                    break;
                case 4: // gradient
                    {
                        uint8_t red_intensity = (uint8_t)((x * 31) / (width - 1));
                        uint8_t green_intensity = (uint8_t)((y * 63) / (height - 1));
                        uint8_t blue_intesity = (uint8_t)(((width - x - 1) * 31) / (width - 1));
                        color = RGB565(red_intensity, green_intensity, blue_intesity);
                    }
                    break;
            }

            *pixel = SWAPENDIAN(color);
            ptr += 2;
        }
    }

    if (-1 == set_image(handle)) {
        break;
    }

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000));
}
```

update function at work:

![alt text](images/updates.png?raw=true)

With the update function, Some cool animations can be done. Although I did notice that after a few cycles, the screen starts to slow down a bit. It seems like there might be an issue with the firmware. My guess is that it was designed to handle a few updates and then take a quick nap for about a second. So, bursts of updates followed by short breaks seem to keep this device happy. But hey, even with that, you can still create some neat stuff, like an analog watch face or even small bursts of animation.

** UPDATE: I noticed when you send the set_time/heartbeat too often it will slow down. if i leave the heartbeat to hit every 1 second, and send the screen updates every 10ms, the animation is much smoother. still have to sleep a little between updates, otherwise you will get a send error.

## Commands for LED strip

the LED strip uses a 5 byte buffer, with a signature 0xfa followed by theme, intensity, speed and a checksum. you open the device like a regular serial port and write bytes to it.

```c++
struct led_command {
    uint8_t signature; // 0xfa
    uint8_t theme;     
    uint8_t intensity;
    uint8_t speed; 
    uint8_t checksum;
};
```
#### theme
```
0x01 = rainbow
0x02 = breathing
0x03 = color cycle
0x04 = off
0x05 = automatic
```
#### intensity
```
0x01 = level 5
0x02 = level 4
0x03 = level 3
0x04 = level 2
0x05 = level 1
```
#### speed
```
0x01 = level 5
0x02 = level 4
0x03 = level 3
0x04 = level 2
0x05 = level 1
```
#### checksum

```
crc = LSB(signature + theme + intensity + speed)
```

turning off the LED strip you will need to send the intesity and speed too. 

## Flow

etc...

## Putting it all together

I finaly received my 1TB WD_BLACK Gen4 NVME and installed the latest ubuntu 23.10, so I can try playing around with this using node.js. I am able to connect using [node-hid](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid) and use the [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) to draw and write text. I'm also looking at [chartjs-node-canvas](https://github.com/SeanSobey/ChartjsNodeCanvas) for the graphs.

```javascript

const node_hid = require('node-hid');
const node_canvas = require('canvas');

node_hid.setDriverType('libusb');

node_hid.HIDAsync.open('1-8:1.1').then(handle => {

    const width = 320;
    const height = 170;
    const canvas = node_canvas.createCanvas(width, height);
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d', { pixelFormat: 'RGB16_565' });

    lcd_redraw(handle, ctx.getImageData(0, 0, width, height));
});
```

Here is a sample of 7pt to 24pt Arial font:

as for the sensors on this S1, using the lm_sensors it only discovers the coretemp:
